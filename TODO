- switch to gen_init_cpio.c from kernel sources to generate cpio with device nodes
  for the usage with CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE

- sysroot update
- static udev -all-static

- add ed25519 for dropbear, drop dsa.
- preserve /run tmpfs, mount move.

- https://bugs.gentoo.org/706434
- switch cryptsetup from libgcrypt to openssl

* Check checksum for distfiles
* Support root-less building with bubblewrap
* Support root-less building with proot
* rewrite lebuild to work inside sysroot instead of interacting with it from outside
* Add fsck for ext2/3/4, btrfs and xfs as optional binaries.
* lookup for bcache lvm softrwaid dmcrypt and generate all combinations with enabled modules for true support of all the storage layers

# OLD:
* Support loadable kernel modules.
* Support for key on external device (enc_keydev and enc_keyfile).
* Support for squashfs in root variable, example: root=SQUASHFS=livecd.img
* Support for aufs3/overlayfs-based rootfs (livesystem). Useful for debuging and liveUSB/CD.
* Better support for keymaps.
* Support BTRFS's subvolumes.
* Support for remote unlock of multiple luks device (Note to self: check whatever fifo is open)
* earlymount option to mount everything possible from /newroot/etc/fstab - that should be good idea if we want to have mountpoints in /var/log for example.
* use debian's idea to rename suspend binary into uswsusp to make it less confusing.
* Add deleyed_block_devices option. Whenever resolv_device() does not find device, wait 1s and repeat, default repeat 30 times. Make the counter configurable.
* Support squash+union for system dirs, like /usr. Squashfs with lz4 pared with OverlayFS (v22+) for rw-layer and image rebuilding on-boot.
